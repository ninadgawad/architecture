## Systems Monitoring
System monitoring involves tracking, logging, and analyzing system resources across all layers of an IT environment, from operating systems to applications and services. 
It enables organizations to manage, operate, and monitor IT systems centrally. 
System monitoring software is crucial for establishing a baseline for system health, detecting underlying problems proactively, collecting data for continuous improvement, enhancing system security and performance, and more


## Prometheus 
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit that was originally built at SoundCloud in 2012. It collects and stores metrics as time series data, allowing users to monitor various aspects of their systems such as request times for web servers or active connections for databases. Prometheus has a highly dimensional data model, a flexible query language called PromQL, and efficient time series database storage. It is designed for reliability, operates independently relying only on local storage, and is widely used in monitoring machine-centric and service-oriented architectures. Prometheus is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is known for its scalability, flexibility, and ease of deployment due to being written in Go
